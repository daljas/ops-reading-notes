# Jason Dallas Ops Reading Notes

## Reading #5

 1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?

   Shell= command line interpreter. Interface for accessing the services of an operating system

   terminal=  text input and output environment. terminal is a program that displays a graphical interface and allows you to interact with the shell.

   Cli= computer program that processes commands in the form of lines of text. The user typically interacts with the shell via a command-line interface

   Command prompt= it is used to excute enter commands on a compuer

 2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?

   You use MV and ls commands to move and rename and cd change directories.

 3.What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?

  An absolute path always points to the same resource. Relative paths point to a resource relative to something else. When ~ is used, it is normally used to be expanded to the current user home directory\

 4.Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
